```{r}
data("FishEggs")
#3.34a: -0.21033 * age + 38.70206 = PctDM, this indicates a negative linear relationship between the two. 
mymodeel <- lm(PctDM~Age, data = FishEggs)

summary(mymodeel)

#3.34b: r^2 = 0.2004, 20.04% of the variability in PctDM is explained by age. 

#3.34c: pval = 0.007001, the data is statistically significant because our pval is <0.05.

#3.35d: Constant variance looks good, zero mean looks solid. No clear pattern. Eq variance looks good.
